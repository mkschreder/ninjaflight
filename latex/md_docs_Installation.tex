\subsection*{Using the configurator}

This is a generic procedure to flash a board using the configurator. The configurator does not yet support all boards, so please check the documentation corresponding to your board before proceeding.

Make sure you have the \href{https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight-configurator}{\tt Cleanflight Configurator} installed, then\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Connect the flight controller to the P\+C.
\item Start the Cleanflight Configurator.
\item Click on \char`\"{}\+Disconnect\char`\"{} if the configurator connected to the board automatically.
\item Click on the \char`\"{}\+Firmware Flasher\char`\"{} tab.
\item Make sure you have internet connectivity and click on the \char`\"{}\+Load Firmware \mbox{[}\+Online\mbox{]}\char`\"{} button.
\item Click on the \char`\"{}\+Choose a Firmware / Board\char`\"{} dropdown menu, and select the latest stable version for your flight controller.
\item I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+N\+T\+: Read and understand the release notes that are displayed. When upgrading review all release notes since your current firmware.
\item If this is the first time Cleanflight is flashed to the board, tick the \char`\"{}\+Full Chip Erase\char`\"{} checkbox.
\item Connect the flight controller board to the P\+C. Ensure the correct serial port is selected.
\item Click on the \char`\"{}\+Flash Firmware\char`\"{} button and hold still (do not breathe, too).
\item When the progress bar becomes green and reads \char`\"{}\+Programming\+: S\+U\+C\+C\+E\+S\+S\+F\+U\+L\char`\"{} you are done!
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Manually}

See the board specific flashing instructions.

\section*{Upgrading}

When upgrading be sure to backup / dump your existing settings. Some firmware releases are not backwards compatible and default settings are restored when the F\+C detects an out of date configuration.

\subsection*{Backup/\+Restore process}

See the C\+L\+I section of the docs for details on how to backup and restore your configuration via the C\+L\+I.
