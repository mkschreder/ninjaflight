R\+S\+S\+I is a measurement of signal strength and is very handy so you know when your aircraft isw going out of range or if it is suffering R\+F interference.

Some receivers have R\+S\+S\+I outputs. 3 types are supported.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item R\+S\+S\+I via P\+P\+M channel
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item R\+S\+S\+I via Parallel P\+W\+M channel
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item R\+S\+S\+I via A\+D\+C with P\+P\+M R\+C that has an R\+S\+S\+I output -\/ aka R\+S\+S\+I A\+D\+C
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{R\+S\+S\+I via P\+P\+M}

Configure your receiver to output R\+S\+S\+I on a spare channel, then select the channel used via the C\+L\+I.

e.\+g. if you used channel 9 then you would set\+:

``` set rssi\+\_\+channel = 9 ``` Note\+: Some systems such as E\+Z\+U\+H\+F invert the R\+S\+S\+I ( 0 = Full signal / 100 = Lost signal). To correct this problem you can invert the channel input so you will get a correct reading by using command\+:

``` set rssi\+\_\+ppm\+\_\+invert = 1 ``` Default is set to \char`\"{}0\char`\"{} for normal operation ( 100 = Full signal / 0 = Lost signal).

\subsection*{R\+S\+S\+I via Parallel P\+W\+M channel}

Connect the R\+S\+S\+I signal to any P\+W\+M input channel then set the R\+S\+S\+I channel as you would for R\+S\+S\+I via P\+P\+M

\subsection*{R\+S\+S\+I A\+D\+C}

Connect the R\+S\+S\+I signal to the R\+C2/\+C\+H2 input. The signal must be between 0v and 3.\+3v. Use inline resistors to lower voltage if required; inline smoothing capacitors may also help. A simple P\+P\+M-\/$>$R\+S\+S\+I conditioner can easily be made. See the P\+P\+M-\/\+R\+S\+S\+I conditioning.\+pdf for details.

Under C\+L\+I \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item enable using the R\+S\+S\+I\+\_\+\+A\+D\+C feature \+: {\ttfamily feature R\+S\+S\+I\+\_\+\+A\+D\+C}
\item set the R\+S\+S\+I\+\_\+\+S\+C\+A\+L\+E parameter (between 1 and 255) to adjust R\+S\+S\+I level according to your configuration.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Fr\+Sky D4\+R-\/\+I\+I and X8\+R supported.

The feature can not be used when R\+X\+\_\+\+P\+A\+R\+A\+L\+L\+E\+L\+\_\+\+P\+W\+M is enabled.
