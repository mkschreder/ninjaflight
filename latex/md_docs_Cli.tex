Cleanflight has a command line interface (C\+L\+I) that can be used to change settings and configure the F\+C.

\subsection*{Accessing the C\+L\+I.}

The C\+L\+I can be accessed via the G\+U\+I tool or via a terminal emulator connected to the C\+L\+I serial port.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Connect your terminal emulator to the C\+L\+I serial port (which, by default, is the same as the M\+S\+P serial port)
\item Use the baudrate specified by msp\+\_\+baudrate (115200 by default).
\item Send a {\ttfamily \#} character.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To save your settings type in 'save', saving will reboot the flight controller.

To exit the C\+L\+I without saving power off the flight controller or type in 'exit'.

To see a list of other commands type in 'help' and press return.

To dump your configuration (including the current profile), use the 'dump' command.

See the other documentation sections for details of the cli commands and settings that are available.

\subsection*{Backup via C\+L\+I}

Disconnect main power, connect to cli via U\+S\+B/\+F\+T\+D\+I.

dump using cli

``` rateprofile 0 profile 0 dump ```

dump profiles using cli if you use them

``` profile 1 dump profile profile 2 dump profile ```

dump rate profiles using cli if you use them

``` rateprofile 1 dump rates rateprofile 2 dump rates ``` copy screen output to a file and save it.

\subsection*{Restore via C\+L\+I.}

Use the cli {\ttfamily defaults} command first.

When restoring from a backup it is a good idea to do a dump of the latest defaults so you know what has changed -\/ if you do this each time a firmware release is created youwill be able to see the cli changes between firmware versions. For instance, in December 2014 the default G\+P\+S navigation P\+I\+Ds changed. If you blindly restore your backup you would not benefit from these new defaults.

Use the C\+L\+I and send all the output from the saved backup commands.

Do not send the file too fast, if you do the F\+C might not be able to keep up when using U\+S\+A\+R\+T adapters (including built in ones) since there is no hardware serial flow control.

You may find you have to copy/paste a few lines at a time.

Repeat the backup process again!

Compare the two backups to make sure you are happy with your restored settings.

Re-\/apply any new defaults as desired.

A way to find out if this needs to be changed, is to clear all trim/subtrim on transmitter, and connect to G\+U\+I. Note the value most channels idle at -\/ this should be the number to choose.

For example, setting to 8000 will use brushed mode at 8k\+Hz switching frequency. Up to 32k\+Hz is supported. Default is 16000 for boards with brushed motors.
