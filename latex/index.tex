An even cleaner version of cleanflight flight-\/controller. Flight controllers are used to fly multi-\/rotor craft and fixed wing aircraft.

I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+N\+T N\+O\+T\+E\+: currently \char`\"{}master\char`\"{} git branch (which you are probably looking at) is undergoing many {\itshape major} changes so it is not going to work.

Latest release\+: 1.\+16.\+10 (Codename\+: \char`\"{}\+Panic In The Sewers\char`\"{})

This fork differs from cleanflight in that it introduces S\+I\+T\+L (software in the loop) support that is able to simulate the flight controller in a simulated physics environment powered by Bullet physics. It also adds support for tilted motor quads and uses modern development practices to simplify maintainability and improve quality of the firmware.

This is done by\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using code coverage to write better unit tests (aiming at 100\% coverage for all code).
\item Using object oriented design in C with minimal use of static/global data
\item Separating modules into as small modules as possible each of which can be unit tested separately.
\item Testing on S\+I\+T\+L, through unit tests and on real hardware in parallel to achieve greater robustness.
\end{DoxyItemize}

U\+P\+D\+A\+T\+E\+: new changes will be published into master branch. This means that most of the time master branch contains potentially untested code. For stable firmware use tagged version releases.

\subsection*{S\+I\+T\+L}

Simulator is an integral part of the development cycle. It is however located in a separate repo and requires some data files to work (notably pak0.\+pk3 from quake3). Main makefile can already download the necessary files for you.

To build and run the sitl on linux you can do the following\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make start-sitl
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Multi-\/color R\+G\+B L\+E\+D strip support (each L\+E\+D can be a different color using variable length W\+S2811 addressable R\+G\+B strips -\/ use for orientation indicators, low battery warning, flight mode status, etc.).
\item Oneshot E\+S\+C support.
\item Blackbox flight recorder logging (to onboard flash or external S\+D card).
\item Support for additional targets that use the S\+T\+M32\+F3 processors (baseflight only supports S\+T\+M32\+F1).
\item Support for the Seriously Pro Racing F3 board (S\+T\+M32\+F303, I2\+C sensors, large flash, excellent I/\+O.).
\item Support for the Tau\+Labs Sparky board (S\+T\+M32\+F303, I2\+C sensors, based board with acc/gyro/compass and baro, $\sim$\$35).
\item Support for the Open\+Pilot C\+C3\+D board (S\+T\+M32\+F103, board, S\+P\+I acc/gyro, $\sim$\$20).
\item Support for the C\+J\+M\+C\+U nano quadcopter board.
\item Support for developer breakout boards\+: (Port103\+R, E\+U\+S\+T\+M32\+F103\+R\+C, Olimexino, S\+T\+M32\+F3\+Discovery).
\item Support for more than 8 R\+C channels -\/ (e.\+g. 16 Channels via Fr\+Sky X4\+R\+S\+B S\+Bus).
\item Support for N-\/\+Position switches via flexible channel ranges -\/ not just 3 like baseflight or 3/6 in Multi\+Wii.
\item Lux's new P\+I\+D (uses float values internally, resistant to looptime variation).
\item Simultaneous Bluetooth configuration and O\+S\+D.
\item Better P\+W\+M and P\+P\+M input and failsafe detection than baseflight.
\item Better Fr\+Sky Telemetry than baseflight.
\item L\+T\+M Telemetry.
\item Smartport Telemetry.
\item R\+S\+S\+I via A\+D\+C -\/ Uses A\+D\+C to read P\+W\+M R\+S\+S\+I signals, tested with Fr\+Sky D4\+R-\/\+I\+I and X8\+R.
\item O\+L\+E\+D Displays -\/ Display information on\+: Battery voltage, profile, rate profile, version, sensors, R\+C, etc.
\item In-\/flight manual P\+I\+D tuning and rate adjustment.
\item Rate profiles and in-\/flight selection of them.
\item Graupner P\+P\+M failsafe.
\item Graupner Ho\+T\+T telemetry.
\item Multiple simultaneous telemetry providers.
\item Configurable serial ports for Serial R\+X, Telemetry, M\+S\+P, G\+P\+S -\/ Use most devices on any port, softserial too.
\item And many more minor bug fixes.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Ninjaflight also supports\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+I\+T\+L simulation support
\item Tilted propeller racing drones with dynamic and static tilting. Throttle compensation and yaw/roll compensation is also supported.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Installation}

See\+: \hyperlink{md_docs_Installation}{Installation.md}

\subsection*{Documentation}

See\+: \href{https://github.com/mkschreder/ninjaflight/tree/master/docs}{\tt docs folder}

If what you need is not covered, check the \href{https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight/tree/master/docs}{\tt Cleanflight documentation}.

In many ways currently ninjaflight works exactly like cleanflight so a lot of things are already covered by cleanflight documentation (although this may change as the project evolves).

\subsection*{Configuration Tool}

To configure Ninjaflight you can use the \href{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cleanflight-configurator/enacoimjcgeinfnnnpajinjgmkahmfgb}{\tt Cleanflight-\/configurator G\+U\+I tool} (Windows/\+O\+S\+X/\+Linux).
