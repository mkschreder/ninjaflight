Alien\+Wii is now Alien\+Flight. This target supports various variants of brushed and brusless flight controllers. The designs for them are released for public use at\+:

\href{http://www.alienflight.com}{\tt http\+://www.\+alienflight.\+com}

All published designs are flight tested by various people. The intention here is to make this flight controllers available and enable skilled users or R\+C vendors to build this designs.

Here are the general hardware specifications for this boards\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+T\+M32\+F103\+C\+B\+T6 M\+C\+U (A\+L\+I\+E\+N\+F\+L\+I\+G\+H\+T\+F1)
\item S\+T\+M32\+F303\+C\+C\+T6 M\+C\+U (A\+L\+I\+E\+N\+F\+L\+I\+G\+H\+T\+F3)
\item M\+P\+U6050/6500/9250 accelerometer/gyro(/mag) sensor unit
\item The M\+P\+U sensor interrupt is connected to the M\+C\+U for all new F3 designs and enabled in the firmware
\item 4-\/8 x 4.\+2\+A to 9.\+5\+A brushed E\+S\+Cs, integrated, to run the strongest micro motors
\item extra-\/wide traces on the P\+C\+B, for maximum power throughput
\item U\+S\+B port, integrated
\item ($\ast$) serial connection for external D\+S\+M2/\+D\+S\+M\+X sat receiver (e.\+g. Spektrum S\+A\+T, Orange\+Rx R100, Lemon R\+X or Deltang Rx31)
\item C\+P\+P\+M input
\item ground and 3.\+3\+V for the receiver
\item hardware bind plug for easy binding
\item motor connections are at the corners for a clean look with reduced wiring
\item small footprint
\item direct operation from an single cell lipoly battery
\item 3.\+3\+V L\+D\+O power regulator (older prototypes)
\item 3.\+3\+V buck-\/boost power converter (all new versions)
\item 5\+V buck-\/boost power converter for F\+P\+V (some versions)
\item battery monitoring with an L\+E\+D for buzzer functionality (actually for some A\+L\+I\+E\+N\+F\+L\+I\+G\+H\+T\+F3 variants only)
\end{DoxyItemize}

($\ast$) Spektrum Compatible D\+S\+M2 satellites are supported out of the box. D\+S\+M\+X sat will work with D\+S\+M2 protocol with default settings (D\+S\+M2, 11bit, 11ms is preset). This is chosen for maximum compatibility. For optimal connection it is recommended to adjust settings to match the capabilities of your transmitter and satellite receiver. If possible it is recommended to use the D\+S\+M\+X protocol since it is known as more reliable. Also to make use of additional channels you should adjust the following two parameters with the Cleanflight Configurator. \begin{DoxyVerb}set serialrx_provider = 1   (0 for 1024bit, 1 for 2048bit) 
set spektrum_sat_bind = 5
\end{DoxyVerb}


For more detail of the different bind modes please refer the Spektrum bind.\+md \char`\"{}\+Spektrum Bind\char`\"{} document

Deltang receivers in serial mode will work like any other Spektrum satellite receiver (10bit, 22ms) only the bind process will be different.

The pin layout for the A\+L\+I\+E\+N\+F\+L\+I\+G\+H\+T\+F1 is very similar to N\+A\+Z\+E32 or the related clones (M\+W32, Flip32, etc.). The hardware bind pin is connected to pin 41 (P\+B5). The pin layout for the A\+L\+I\+E\+N\+F\+L\+I\+G\+H\+T\+F3 is similar to Sparky. The hardware bind pin is connected to pin 25 (P\+B12). The new Alien\+Flight\+F3 V2 design have the sensor connected via S\+P\+I and some slightly different pin layout. All Alien\+Flight/\+Alien\+Wii F3 layouts running the same firmware which takes care on the differences with an hardware detection.

The Alien\+Flight firmware will be built as target A\+L\+I\+E\+N\+F\+L\+I\+G\+H\+T\+F1 or A\+L\+I\+E\+N\+F\+L\+I\+G\+H\+T\+F3. The firmware image will come with alternative default settings which will give the user a plug and play experience. There is no computer needed to get this into the air with an small Quadcopter. An preconfigured custom mixer for an Octocopter is part of the default settings to allow clean straight wiring with the Alien\+Flight. The mixer can be activated with \char`\"{}mixer custom\char`\"{} in the C\+L\+I. To use the Alien\+Flight in an Hexa-\/ or Octocopter or to do some more tuning. Additional configuration changes can be done as usual in the C\+L\+I or the Cleanflight configurator.

\subsection*{Flashing the firmware}

The firmware can be updated with the Cleanflight configurator as for any other target. All Alien\+Flight boards have an boot jumper which need to be closed for the initial flashing or for recovery from an broken firmware.
