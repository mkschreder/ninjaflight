\#\+Travis

Cleanflight provides Travis build and config files in the repository root.

\subsection*{Pushing builds to a remote server}

{\ttfamily .travis.\+sh} script can upload build artifacts to a remote server. This feature is controlled by the {\ttfamily P\+U\+B\+L\+I\+S\+H\+\_\+\+U\+R\+L} environment variable. If set, the build script will use the c\+U\+R\+L binary and simulate a file upload post to the configured server.

Pleas check the {\ttfamily notifications} section in the {\ttfamily .travis.\+yml} file and adjust the irc notifications if you plan on using Travis on your Cleanflight fork
