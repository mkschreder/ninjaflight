Oneshot allows faster communication between the Flight Controller and the E\+S\+Cs that are present on your multirotor.

It does this in two ways\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Use a signal that varies between 125 µs and 250 µs (instead of the normal P\+W\+M timing of 1000µs to 2000µs)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Only send a 'shot' once per flight controller loop, and do this as soon as the flight controller has calculated the required speed of the motors.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Supported E\+S\+Cs}

Fly\+Duino K\+I\+S\+S E\+S\+Cs are able to use the Oneshot125 protocol out of the box. There is only one soldering needed. B\+L\+Heli rev13.\+0 also supports Oneshot125 and will be automatically selected by the E\+S\+C without additional work.

\subsection*{Supported Boards}

The Naze boards are supported, and have been flight tested in a number of configurations.

C\+C3\+D boards have been tested with a P\+P\+M receiver, however parallel P\+W\+M receivers might not work properly with this board.

\subsection*{Enabling Oneshot}

To configure Oneshot, you must turn off any power to your E\+S\+Cs.

It is a good idea at this stage to configure your E\+S\+C for oneshot mode (by soldering J\+P1 in the case of the K\+I\+S\+S E\+S\+C).

Connect a U\+S\+B cable to your board, and connect using the Chrome G\+U\+I app.

Go to the C\+L\+I tab, and type the following\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}feature ONESHOT125
save
\end{DoxyVerb}


Then you can safely power up your E\+S\+Cs again.

\subsection*{Configuration}

The process for calibrating oneshot E\+S\+Cs is the same as any other E\+S\+C.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Ensure that your E\+S\+Cs are not powered up.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Connect to the board using a U\+S\+B cable, and change to the motor test page.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Set the motor speed to maximum using the main slider.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Connect power to your E\+S\+Cs. They will beep.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Click on the slider to bring the motor speed down to zero. The E\+S\+Cs will beep again, usually a couple of times.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Disconnect the power from your E\+S\+Cs.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Re-\/connect power to your E\+S\+Cs, and verify that moving the motor slider makes your motors spin up normally.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
