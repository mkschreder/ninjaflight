\item When R\+C sticks are in T\+H\+R\+\_\+\+L\+O + Y\+A\+W\+\_\+\+H\+I + P\+I\+T\+\_\+\+C\+E + R\+O\+L\+\_\+\+C\+E the R\+C\+\_\+\+K\+E\+Y\+\_\+\+S\+T\+I\+C\+K\+\_\+\+A\+R\+M goes into P\+R\+E\+S\+S\+E\+D state and should go back to R\+E\+L\+E\+A\+S\+E\+D state when sticks are centered.
\item When any key is triggered the event callback of the event listener should be called as well.
