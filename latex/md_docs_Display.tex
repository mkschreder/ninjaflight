Cleanflight supports displays to provide information to you about your aircraft and cleanflight state.

When the aircraft is armed the display does not update so flight is not affected. When disarmed the display cycles between various pages.

There is currently no way to change the information on the pages, the list of pages or the time between pages -\/ Code submissions via pull-\/requests are welcomed!

\subsection*{Supported Hardware}

At this time no other displays are supported other than the S\+S\+D1306 / U\+G-\/2864\+H\+S\+W\+E\+G01.

\subsection*{Configuration}

From the C\+L\+I enable the {\ttfamily D\+I\+S\+P\+L\+A\+Y} feature

``` feature D\+I\+S\+P\+L\+A\+Y ```

\subsubsection*{S\+S\+D1306 O\+L\+E\+D displays}

The S\+S\+D1306 display is a 128x64 O\+L\+E\+D display that is visible in full sunlight, small and consumes very little current. This makes it ideal for aircraft use.

There are various models of S\+S\+D1306 boards out there, they are not all equal and some require addtional modifications before they work. Choose wisely!

The banggood.\+com display is the cheapest at the time fo writing and will correctly send I2\+C A\+C\+K signals.

\paragraph*{Crius C\+O-\/16}

This display is best avoided but will work if you modify it.

Step 1

As supplied the I2\+C ack signal is not sent because the manufacturer did not bridge D1 and D2 together. To fix this solder the two pins together as they enter the screen. Failure to do this will result is a screen that doesn't display anything.

Step 2

Pin 14 must be disconnected from the main board using a scalpel. Then connect a 10n\+F or 100n\+F capacitor between pins 30 and the lifted pin 14.

Step 3

Connect a 100\+K resistor between Pin 9 and the lifted Pin 14.

Failure to perform steps 2 and 3 will result in a display that only works on power up some of the time any may display random dots or other display corruption.

\subsection*{Connections}

Connect +5v, Ground, I2\+C S\+D\+A and I2\+C S\+C\+L from the flight controller to the display.

On Naze32 rev 5 boards the S\+D\+A and S\+C\+L pads are underneath the board.
