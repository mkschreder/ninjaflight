The Seriously Pro Racing F3 Mini (S\+P\+Racing\+F3\+Mini) is the second flight controller board designed specifically for Cleanflight. It is the only F\+C that supports all the latest Cleanflight features and the O\+N\+L\+Y mini board with a full feature set that can also be mounted in mini frames as well as in standard 36x36mm mounting holes. With the new transponder feature it is the only truly race ready board available.

It's full feature set, size and weight makes it perfect for incorporating in sub-\/250g drones to comply with U\+S\+A drone regulations.

Purchasing boards directly from Seriously\+Pro / S\+P Racing and official retailers helps fund Cleanflight development, it's the reason the Seriously Pro boards exist! Official retailers are always listed on the Seriously\+Pro.\+com website.

\subsubsection*{Transponder Section.}

The transponder section of the board is where up to two I\+R leds (supplied) can be connected for the race timing transponder system. It can left attached, stacked above or below the main board or detached and connected via a cable, as appropriate.

The transponder section has a small enable jumper which must be bridged with solder before using the I\+R transponder feature.

\paragraph*{Bottom Left and Bottom Right Transponder I\+O (Left to Right)}

For L\+E\+D / I\+R. The 4 pins arranged in a square by the mounting holes of the transponder board have the same pinouts on the left and right hand sides of the board. They are the same so that a 4 pin cable can be attached either side when relocating the transponder section.
