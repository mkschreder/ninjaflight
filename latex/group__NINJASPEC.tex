This is a summary of automatic tests that are done against the flight controller in full. Each requirement is always backed by a unit test.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item T\+O\+D\+O\+: Flight controller automatically detects if sensors are connected by inspecting return values from system calls that read the sensors. If sensors are disconnected or otherwise not available then system calls should return -\/\+E\+N\+O\+E\+N\+T (or other negative value). On success system calls will return zero.
