Building in Mac O\+S X can be accomplished in just a few steps\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install general development tools (clang, make, git)
\item Install A\+R\+M G\+C\+C 4.\+9 series compiler
\item Checkout Cleanflight sourcecode through git
\item Build the code
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Install general development tools (clang, make, git)}

Open up a terminal and run {\ttfamily make}. If it is installed already, you should see a message like this, which means that you already have the required development tools installed\+:

``` make\+: $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop. ```

If it isn't installed yet, you might get a popup like this. If so, click the \char`\"{}install\char`\"{} button to install the commandline developer tools\+:



If you just get an error like this instead of a helpful popup prompt\+:

``` -\/bash\+: make\+: command not found ```

Try running {\ttfamily xcode-\/select -\/-\/install} instead to trigger the popup.

If that doesn't work, you'll need to install the X\+Code development environment \href{https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835}{\tt from the App Store}. After installation, open up X\+Code and enter its preferences menu. Go to the \char`\"{}downloads\char`\"{} tab and install the \char`\"{}command line tools\char`\"{} package.

\subsection*{Install A\+R\+M G\+C\+C 4.\+9 series compiler}

Cleanflight is built using the 4.\+9 series G\+C\+C compiler provided by the \href{https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded}{\tt G\+N\+U Tools for A\+R\+M Embedded Processors project}.

Hit the \char`\"{}all downloads\char`\"{} link on the right side of the G\+N\+U Tools for A\+R\+M page to view \href{https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download}{\tt the older releases}. Grab the Mac installation tarball for the latest version in the 4.\+9 series (e.\+g. 4.\+9-\/2015q2). Move it somewhere useful such as a {\ttfamily $\sim$/development} folder (in your home directory) and double click it to unpack it. You should end up with a folder called {\ttfamily $\sim$/development/gcc-\/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/4\+\_\+9-\/2015q2/}.

Now you just need to add the {\ttfamily bin/} directory from inside the G\+C\+C directory to your system's path. Run {\ttfamily nano $\sim$/.profile}. Add a new line at the end of the file which adds the path for the {\ttfamily bin/} folder to your path, like so\+:

``` export P\+A\+T\+H=\$\+P\+A\+T\+H\+:$\sim$/development/gcc-\/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/4\+\_\+9-\/2015q2/bin ```

Press C\+T\+R\+L+\+X to exit nano, and answer \char`\"{}y\char`\"{} when prompted to save your changes.

Now {\itshape close this terminal window} and open a new one. Try running\+:

``` arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/gcc --version ```

You should get output similar to\+:

``` arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/gcc.\+exe (G\+N\+U Tools for A\+R\+M Embedded Processors) 4.\+9.\+3 20150529 (release) \mbox{[}A\+R\+M/embedded-\/4\+\_\+9-\/branch revision 224288\mbox{]} Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc. This is free software; see the source for copying conditions. There is N\+O warranty; not even for M\+E\+R\+C\+H\+A\+N\+T\+A\+B\+I\+L\+I\+T\+Y or F\+I\+T\+N\+E\+S\+S F\+O\+R A P\+A\+R\+T\+I\+C\+U\+L\+A\+R P\+U\+R\+P\+O\+S\+E. ```

If {\ttfamily arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/gcc} couldn't be found, go back and check that you entered the correct path in your {\ttfamily $\sim$/.profile} file.

\subsection*{Checkout Clean\+Flight sourcecode through git}

Enter your development directory and clone the \href{https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight}{\tt Cleanflight repository} using the \char`\"{}\+H\+T\+T\+P\+S clone U\+R\+L\char`\"{} which is shown on the right side of the Cleanflight Git\+Hub page, like so\+:

``` git clone \href{https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight.git}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/cleanflight/cleanflight.\+git} ```

This will download the entire Cleanflight repository for you into a new folder called \char`\"{}cleanflight\char`\"{}.

\subsection*{Build the code}

Enter the cleanflight directory and run {\ttfamily make T\+A\+R\+G\+E\+T=N\+A\+Z\+E} to build firmware for the Naze32. When the build completes, the .hex firmware should be available as {\ttfamily obj/cleanflight\+\_\+\+N\+A\+Z\+E.\+hex} for you to flash using the Cleanflight Configurator.

\subsection*{Updating to the latest source}

If you want to erase your local changes and update to the latest version of the Cleanflight source, enter your cleanflight directory and run these commands to first erase your local changes, fetch and merge the latest changes from the repository, then rebuild the firmware\+:

``` git reset --hard git pull

make clean T\+A\+R\+G\+E\+T=N\+A\+Z\+E make T\+A\+R\+G\+E\+T=N\+A\+Z\+E ```
