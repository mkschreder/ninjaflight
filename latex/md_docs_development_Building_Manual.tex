\#\+Building Manual.

The manual P\+D\+F file is generated by concatenating relevant markdown files and by transforming the result using Gimli to obtain the final P\+D\+F file. This steps are handled automatically by the {\ttfamily build\+\_\+docs.\+sh} script located in the root of the repository next to the Makefile.

\subsection*{Requirements \& Installation}

The P\+D\+F manual generation uses the Gimli for the conversion. It can be installed via ruby gems. On Debian based systems the installation steps are\+: ```bash sudo apt-\/get install ruby1.\+9.\+1 ruby1.\+9.\+1-\/dev rubygems zlib1g-\/dev wkhtmltopdf libxml2-\/dev libxslt-\/dev sudo gem1.\+9.\+1 install gimli ```

\subsection*{Configuration}

All markdown files need to be registered in the {\ttfamily build\+\_\+manual.\+sh} file individually by modifying the {\ttfamily doc\+\_\+files} variable / array\+: ```bash doc\+\_\+files=( '\hyperlink{Configuration_8md}{Configuration.\+md}' 'Board -\/ C\+C3\+D.\+md' '...' '...' ) ```
